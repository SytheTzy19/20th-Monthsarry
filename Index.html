      <p>Dear Nicole Mish Batobato,</p>
      <p>I can hardly believe it's been 20 months since we started this journey together, and although we may be physically apart, our love has only grown stronger.</p>
      <p>Being in a long distance relationship is not always easy, but you make it so much more bearable with your unwavering love and support. You constantly amaze me with your strength, your kindness, and your ability to make me feel loved even when we're miles apart.</p>
      <p>Despite the distance between us, we have built a strong and meaningful relationship. I cherish every moment we spend together, whether it's through video calls, texting, or sending each other care packages. I look forward to the day when we can finally be together in person and make up for all the time we've spent apart.</p>
      <p>Thank you for being my rock, my confidant, and my partner in this journey. I promise to continue to love you and support you through everything that life throws our way. Here's to many more months (and hopefully soon, years!) of happiness together.</p>
      <p>I love you more than words can express.</p>
